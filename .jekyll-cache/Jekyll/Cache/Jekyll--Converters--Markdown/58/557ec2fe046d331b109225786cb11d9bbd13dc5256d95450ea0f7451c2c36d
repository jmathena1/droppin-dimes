<p>for some ludcrious lyrical mastery.<br />
The poems here have no order other than chronological. That may change some day.<br />
For each poem, I give a short blurb on what I thought about when writing.<br />
It wonâ€™t be much and I promise it wonâ€™t give away what each poem is â€˜aboutâ€™.<br />
That dear reader, is up to you.</p>
