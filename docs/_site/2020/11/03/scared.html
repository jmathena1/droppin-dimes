	<h2>Scared</h2>
	<p>03 Nov 2020 - John Mathena</p>
</div>

<main class="blog-post-content">
<p>place is straight packed<br />
I could not believe<br />
My naive little eyes<br />
watching a ravens game<br />
during a late brunch<br />
in a filled bar<br />
surrounded by a pandemic</p>

<p>waiters crammed in between<br />
at the bar, the tables, the bathroom<br />
publicly smiling<br />
secretly panicking</p>

<p>with us<br />
eating our eggs, drinking our drinks<br />
failing to convince each other<br />
that business is as usual<br />
and that <br />
is the scariest part</p>

<p><em>(2023-06-01) Here I had just eaten inside a restaurant I think for the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic. I felt nothing but anxiety the whole time we sat. I wore my mask. I tried to go to the bathroom when there weren’t many other people moving around or standing. Though it was eight months into the pandemic, the return to normalcy amazed me. No vaccines, not as much masking as there should’ve been. I didn’t feel ready. I’m not sure I feel ready now.</em></p>
