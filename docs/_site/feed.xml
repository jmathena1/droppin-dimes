I could not believe&lt;br /&gt;
My naive little eyes&lt;br /&gt;
watching a ravens game&lt;br /&gt;
during a late brunch&lt;br /&gt;
in a filled bar&lt;br /&gt;
surrounded by a pandemic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;waiters crammed in between&lt;br /&gt;
at the bar, the tables, the bathroom&lt;br /&gt;
publicly smiling&lt;br /&gt;
secretly panicking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with us&lt;br /&gt;
eating our eggs, drinking our drinks&lt;br /&gt;
failing to convince each other&lt;br /&gt;
that business is as usual&lt;br /&gt;
and that &lt;br /&gt;
is the scariest part&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2023-06-01) Here I had just eaten inside a restaurant I think for the first time since beforethe COVID-19 pandemic. I felt nothing but anxiety the whole time we sat. I wore my mask. I tried to go to the bathroom when there weren’t many other people moving around or standing. Though it was eight months into the pandemic, the return to normalcy amazed me. No vaccines, not as much masking as there should’ve been. I didn’t feel ready. I’m not sure I feel ready now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John Mathena</name></author><summary type="html">place is straight packed I could not believe My naive little eyes watching a ravens game during a late brunch in a filled bar surrounded by a pandemic</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Survivors March Down Hilton</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/10/03/survivors-march-down-hilton.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Survivors March Down Hilton" /><published>2020-10-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/10/03/survivors-march-down-hilton</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/10/03/survivors-march-down-hilton.html">&lt;p&gt;Their hearts heavy&lt;br /&gt;
Heads high&lt;br /&gt;
Watched over&lt;br /&gt;
By loved ones lost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strivers march down hilton&lt;br /&gt;
Their fists raised&lt;br /&gt;
Waving in the crisp fall air&lt;br /&gt;
Cheered on&lt;br /&gt;
By residents passing by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believers march down hilton&lt;br /&gt;
Their spirits wounded&lt;br /&gt;
But ever so alive&lt;br /&gt;
Chanting those magic words&lt;br /&gt;
Enough is Enough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I attended a peace walk on Hilton Road that started around Green Street Academy in southwest Baltimore. I represented the State’s Attorney’s Office for the Southwestern Police District at the time. We ended the walk standing in front of Freddy P March’s Funeral Home, where both my granparents held their viewings. Although gun violence did not take my grandparents, being back at the home returned a strong feeling of loss. Yet how beautiful it was to see so many people so passionate about using their loved ones’ memories to motivate their fight to make those deaths the last of their kind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John Mathena</name></author><summary type="html">Their hearts heavy Heads high Watched over By loved ones lost</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Down Time</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/09/23/down-time.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Down Time" /><published>2020-09-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-09-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/09/23/down-time</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/09/23/down-time.html">&lt;p&gt;Stimulation pulls my brain&lt;br /&gt;
In like a magnet&lt;br /&gt;
Won’t let me go&lt;br /&gt;
Consumes all that I know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I try to unwind&lt;br /&gt;
And process my time&lt;br /&gt;
Spent click clacking away all day&lt;br /&gt;
Faint buzzing&lt;br /&gt;
Loud chirping&lt;br /&gt;
Last night in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I unite my thoughts&lt;br /&gt;
Out on a page&lt;br /&gt;
Craving release and peace&lt;br /&gt;
Separated from the exhausting stimulation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It rocks my head&lt;br /&gt;
At times filling it with dread&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of giving I simply keep on&lt;br /&gt;
I keep on going&lt;br /&gt;
I write I stay free&lt;br /&gt;
From the stimulation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A doctor diagnosed me with ADD (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/add-vs-adhd&quot;&gt;now considered ADHD&lt;/a&gt;) when I was about six years old. As an adult, one of the most apparent symptoms I still feel is how my brain just never shuts off. There’s always wheels turning somewhere. I’ve journaled and wrote on and off my whole life, but I made it part of my routine in early 2017. Since then, writing’s helped me give my brain space to work and slow down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John Mathena</name></author><summary type="html">Stimulation pulls my brain In like a magnet Won’t let me go Consumes all that I know</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Let Us Grow Up</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/05/06/Let-us-grow-up.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Let Us Grow Up" /><published>2018-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/05/06/Let-us-grow-up</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/05/06/Let-us-grow-up.html">&lt;p&gt;ABCs 123s and Do-re-mis&lt;br /&gt;
School should set our children free&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than shackle their creativity&lt;br /&gt;
As they become target practice &lt;br /&gt;
Resulting from our nation’s inactivity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What message do we send?&lt;br /&gt;
With our barrage of benchmarks?&lt;br /&gt;
That it matters not what you learn&lt;br /&gt;
But what society comprehends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely there is value in shared understanding&lt;br /&gt;
But can our children advance our people on societal grandstanding?&lt;br /&gt;
You cannot task a generation with boundless expectation&lt;br /&gt;
While chastising their setbacks with consternation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be strong&lt;br /&gt;
Be virtuous&lt;br /&gt;
Let your example rise up&lt;br /&gt;
Let our children grow up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m writing this on June 1st, 2023 and yet every word of the poem above remains relevant. Kids in school still must conduct active shooter drills and walk through the doors every day scared that some madman with a rifle will decide today’s the day. Kids in school still struggle, alongside their teachers, to convince those in power that spending each day doing nothing but prepping for high stakes tests is not the best use of anyone’s limited time on this earth. Kids in school still amaze me with their creativity, persistence, and brilliance. I hope with time, only the latter stays true.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John Mathena</name></author><summary type="html">ABCs 123s and Do-re-mis School should set our children free Rather than shackle their creativity As they become target practice Resulting from our nation’s inactivity</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lahboul</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/05/05/Lahboul.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lahboul" /><published>2018-05-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/05/05/Lahboul</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/05/05/Lahboul.html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Lahboul&lt;br /&gt;
Take in the sights&lt;br /&gt;
Of fools, ghouls, and tools &lt;br /&gt;
Without any rights&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can shield your eyes and ears&lt;br /&gt;
As you try desperately to blend&lt;br /&gt;
But your mere existence incites fear&lt;br /&gt;
Your futile urban camouflage amounts to a dead end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creatures that look, talk, and walk the same&lt;br /&gt;
Pounce on the strange and exotic&lt;br /&gt;
And on those who do not play their game&lt;br /&gt;
Their world becoming jarringly chaotic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t denigrate these mammals&lt;br /&gt;
For in the face of the unknown, failing to be cool&lt;br /&gt;
For we are all animals&lt;br /&gt;
In our own versions, of Lahboul&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I walked by a beautiful park near every day when I studied abroad in Meknes, Morocco. Supposedly, there was a zoo somewhere tucked away in the&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;sprawling gardens. I saw very few animals walking by that park. Definitely not enough to warrant a zoo. But that didn’t stop everyone from&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;finding something to leer at.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Many students at the center where I studied talked about how locals would stare at them when they walked around in groups.&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;Women, Black students, Asian students, and gender non-conforming students experienced gawking more frequently and intensely just like they do&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;in the states. Conversely, I remember students doing the same to local Moroccans during our study abroad particularly when we first arrived.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Culture shock hits us all when we travel, especially those used to being a minority.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John Mathena</name></author><summary type="html">Welcome to Lahboul Take in the sights Of fools, ghouls, and tools Without any rights</summary></entry></feed>
