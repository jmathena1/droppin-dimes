Take in the sights&lt;br /&gt;
Of fools, ghouls, and tools &lt;br /&gt;
Without any rights&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can shield your eyes and ears&lt;br /&gt;
As you try desperately to blend&lt;br /&gt;
But your mere existence incites fear&lt;br /&gt;
Your futile urban camouflage amounts to a dead end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creatures that look, talk, and walk the same&lt;br /&gt;
Pounce on the strange and exotic&lt;br /&gt;
And on those who do not play their game&lt;br /&gt;
Their world becoming jarringly chaotic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t denigrate these mammals&lt;br /&gt;
For, in the face of the unknown, failing to be cool&lt;br /&gt;
For, we are all animals&lt;br /&gt;
In our own versions, of Lahboul&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I walked by a beautiful park near every day when I studied abroad in Meknes, Morocco. Supposedly, there was a zoo somewhere tucked away in the&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;sprawling gardens. I saw very few animals walking by that park. Definitely not enough to warrant a zoo. But that didn’t stop everyone from&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;finding something to leer at.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Many students at the center where I studied talked about how locals would stare at them when they walked around in groups.&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;Women, Black students, Asian students, and gender non-conforming students experienced gawking more frequently and intensely just like they do&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;in the states. Conversely, I remember students doing the same to local Moroccans during our study abroad particularly when we first arrived.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Culture shock hits us all when we travel, especially those used to being a minority.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John Mathena</name></author><summary type="html">Welcome to Lahboul Take in the sights Of fools, ghouls, and tools Without any rights</summary></entry></feed>
