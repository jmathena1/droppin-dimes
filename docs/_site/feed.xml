Take in the sights<br />
Of fools, ghouls, and tools <br />
Without any rights</p>

<p>You can shield your eyes and ears<br />
As you try desperately to blend<br />
But your mere existence incites fear<br />
Your futile urban camouflage amounts to a dead end</p>

<p>Creatures that look, talk, and walk the same<br />
Pounce on the strange and exotic<br />
And on those who do not play their game<br />
Their world becoming jarringly chaotic</p>

<p>But don’t denigrate these mammals<br />
For, in the face of the unknown, failing to be cool<br />
For, we are all animals<br />
In our own versions, of Lahboul</p>

<p><em>I walked by a beautiful park near every day when I studied abroad in Meknes, Morocco. Supposedly, there was a zoo somewhere tucked away in the</em> 
<em>sprawling gardens. I saw very few animals walking by that park. Definitely not enough to warrant a zoo. But that didn’t stop everyone from</em>
<em>finding something to leer at.</em>
<em>Many students at the center where I studied talked about how locals would stare at them when they walked around in groups.</em> 
<em>Women, Black students, Asian students, and gender non-conforming students experienced gawking more frequently and intensely just like they do</em>
<em>in the states. Conversely, I remember students doing the same to local Moroccans during our study abroad particularly when we first arrived.</em>
<em>Culture shock hits us all when we travel, especially those used to being a minority.</em></p>]]></content><author><name>John Mathena</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Lahboul Take in the sights Of fools, ghouls, and tools Without any rights]]></summary></entry></feed>
