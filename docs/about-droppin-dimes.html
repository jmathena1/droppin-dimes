    <p class="about-page-content"> for some ludcrious lyrical mastery.<br>  
        The poems here have no order other than chronological. That may change some day.  
        For each poem, I give a short blurb on what I thought about when writing.  
        It won't be much and I promise it won't give away what each poem is <em>about</em>.<br>  
        That dear reader, is up to you.</p>
